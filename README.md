# Machine Learning
Imagine you have a toy robot that can play games with you. When you play games with the toy robot, it can learn how to play better and better each time. This is what we call Machine Learning. The robot is using the information it gets from playing games with you to get better at playing the game. This is similar to how a computer can use information from data to make predictions or take actions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

``` Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and make predictions or take actions without being explicitly programmed to do so. In other words, ML algorithms enable computers to find patterns in data, and use those patterns to make decisions or predictions. The goal of ML is to enable computers to automatically improve their performance on a task with experience.```

**Here are some real-life examples of Machine Learning:**

`1.` **Netflix:** Netflix uses Machine Learning to recommend movies and TV shows to you based on what you have watched before.

`2.` **Siri or Alexa:** Siri or Alexa can answer your questions and perform tasks like playing music, setting reminders, and more. They use Machine Learning to understand what you're asking and provide you with the best answer.

`3.` **Self-driving cars:** Self-driving cars use Machine Learning to learn how to drive on the road and avoid obstacles.

# Types of Machine Learning
`1.` **Supervised Learning:**  In this type of learning, the computer is given a set of labeled examples and learns to predict the label for new, unseen examples. For example, you can give the computer a set of pictures of dogs and cats, and then ask it to classify a new picture as a dog or a cat.

*(Labeled data has both the input and output parameters in a completely machine-readable pattern, but requires a lot of human labor to label the data, to begin with.)*

`2.` **Unsupervised Learning:** In this type of learning, the computer is given a set of unlabeled examples and must find patterns or structure in the data on its own. For example, you can give the computer a set of customer data and ask it to group customers based on similar purchasing patterns.

*(Unlabeled data only has one or none of the parameters in a machine-readable form. This negates the need for human labor but requires more complex solutions.)*

`3.` **Reinforcement Learning:** In this type of learning, the computer learns by taking actions and receiving rewards or punishments. For example, you can give the computer a virtual game and ask it to learn how to play the game to maximize its score.
